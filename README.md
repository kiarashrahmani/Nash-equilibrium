<h1>Bayesian Game Nash Equilibrium Calculator</h1>

<p>This project calculates Nash equilibrium in Bayesian games, specifically a variant of the Bach or Stravinsky (BoS) game with imperfect information.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The game involves two players, each with imperfect information about the other player's preferences. The players receive signals before making decisions, and the Nash equilibrium is calculated based on the given probabilities and payoff matrix.</p>
